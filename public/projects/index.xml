      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;overview&#34;&gt;Overview&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For my final year project, my group was given a task to work on YCEP 2025&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Youth Cyber Exploration Programme (YCEP) was a programme started by CSA and hosted by the 5 polytechnics in Singapore. It is a bootcamp that aims to get students in pre-tertiary education excited about their journey towards a career in cybersecurity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a group, we organised what we would want to be taught for YCEP 2025 and how the curriculum would play out during the 3 day bootcamp at TP.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

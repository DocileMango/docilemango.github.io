## Overview
For my final year project, my group was given a task to work on YCEP 2025

Youth Cyber Exploration Programme (YCEP) was a programme started by CSA and hosted by the 5 polytechnics in Singapore. It is a bootcamp that aims to get students in pre-tertiary education excited about their journey towards a career in cybersecurity.

As a group, we organised what we would want to be taught for YCEP 2025 and how the curriculum would play out during the 3 day bootcamp at TP.

My part in the project is to create learning materials and CTF challenges for participants for reconnaissance (information gathering and OSINT) and Incident response. I also prepared and setup the Kali virtual environment for participants to use, and 4 simple reverse engineering challenges.
